Mr. Saturn is a character from a Super Nintendo RPG from the 90s called "Earthbound". He says things like "Ding", "Boing", and "Kay-O". I've decided to call these words "Saturnisms", for lack of a better word. It is a term I made up.

## Why?
In our darkening world, where chaos is king, we can all use more Saturn. He loves all of us, and he just wants to give all of us somewhere to stay for the night, food, medicine, and maybe nightmares.

Also for fun and to learn how a basic Twitter bot works.
